 You know, mass timber is not the 100% answer to everything, but it is a big part of the solution that's required. So we can adapt ourselves to what the market wants because ultimately we just want to keep our factories busy. Because in the day it's not just about how to install mass timber, it's how we take care of the mass timber. Everything is such an important journey because in the end of the day we want to have a client and we want to repeat business. And strikes normally hybrid, pencil out way better than pure mass timber. And we've been developing different options to hit that sweet middle place where it's not 100% mass timber, but you still have some mass timber to expose and celebrate. And we see these two components specifically to be one of the vectors of growth for the industry in the next 5-10 years. This is the mass timber group show. I'm Nick and I'm Brady and we talk to mass timber experts. Today we caught up with Ricardo Brits and Nick Mouleston with Mercer Mass Timber, one of the largest mass timber producers in North America. Mercer is working on combining CLT with cold form steel for efficient and cost effective hybrid solutions that took us through how and why it's the next big evolution in mass timber construction. And make sure you stick around for the end where we talk about the macroeconomic trends facing the industry and where they see it headed in the next few years. But before we jump in, the biggest issue in the mass timber industry faces right now is awareness and education. And that's what this podcast is for. When you subscribe, more people see it. When more people see it, more people collaborate. And when more people collaborate, more projects get built. So help more mass timber projects get built by hitting the subscribe button. So with that, let's get into it. Hello everyone. I'm Ricardo Brits. I'm the director of engineering and VDC for Mercer Mass Timber. I'm with the company for the last 2 years. And I'm Nick Malser. I'm the vice president for projects and construction for Mercer Mass Timber, a business in June 2022, vulnerable for all non-factor related activities from sales, marketing, project management, engineering, detailing, coordination and construction services activities. All right. Well, thank you, gentlemen, both for being here. We appreciate your time. We're excited to learn a little bit more about what Mercer has been up to. I actually went up in Georgia. You guys is a facility in Spokane a few months ago, I met with Ryan took us around. So I'm excited to talk a little bit more about you guys outside of the factory setting. So I know we're going to jump in a lot and talk about CLT and cold form steel integration, but first like at a high level, what's Mercer been up to lately and what you guys focused on? Yeah, so I'll give you a sort of a background. So since the acquisition of the CLT facility in Spokane, in I believe it was August 2021, effectively myself and Ricardo were brought on to develop CLT sales, CLT that forms part of structural build system components. And that was an amazing journey. We picked up some projects. We developed our core skills in engineering and detailing project management and estimating. And then that was really accelerated when Osmercer acquired the structural amazets out of bankruptcy in June 2023, which not only gave us incredible firepower in terms of available capacity above CLT and glue lamb, which we've done a glue lamb in our our our our memory, but also gave us an immense amount of staff to seriously accelerate the infrastructure we need to service both client projects and fill out the same. And so we've kind of started off as nobody knowing who we are to probably what is now the largest available capacity of mass timber products in North America. And it's been nothing but short of an exciting and crazy journey over the last two years. And we're immensely proud of what we've achieved that kind of from from you know, from nothing to sort of everything in a in a in a birth of pioneering and a growth market as well. And we've needed the firepower of the and we were fortunate to have the firepower of the acquisition of structural and especially because we brought in the much needed staff or project managers and detailers, which really complemented our capabilities of engineering that we'd already created the dynamic and it was just a lovely parent. And and now we've started to stand back and look ourselves and you know in our sort of domain of myself and Ricardo, we're about a 50 strong team. And that just doesn't happen overnight, you know, that takes a lot of knowledge because knowledge in mass timber on planet earth is is fueling far between as we've found out. So we're in a great position now to create good succession planning on the team that we've we've managed to acquire and and everybody's excited for the future for sure. What have you been up to on the engineering side Ricardo? Well, we've been doing a lot of things in different build systems, but also servicing the projects we have won since on after the acquisition. And so we've been very excited on the very busy and very excited with projects we have to deliver, you know, the normal, I will say approval and delivery process, but also developing new build systems, new solutions that the market is looking forward to have hybrid solutions. We will talk a bit about it later on hopefully, but also looking into ways of improving efficiencies internally, right. So as Nick mentioned, we have a team of detailers that we inherit from the old structural lamp. We have a team of being coordinators in house. This is all in house is not outsourced and we have a team of engineers. We have world experts on these three areas, which makes us a very powerful, you know, team to engage with in early design assist periods, for example, but also all the way up to construction. We also have construction services. So definitely it's we've been kind of, you know, building some muskle in the background to make sure that we can service the projects we have. Yeah, well, I'm excited to unpack that a little bit more. What kind of operational improvements have you guys made in this last couple of years? The factory spoke and and Conway comes under our general manager, Jason Herman, Jason's a very experienced mass timber GM any sort of you continually improve your facilities constantly by little tweaks. It's like a Formula 1 car, it's probably the best way to describe it and it's our relationship with factories. We under Ricardo's domain, we responsibility, we we give all the necessary what we call CAD CAM files, CNC files, which is the outputs from the 3D modeling, which is a result of the BIM coordination. The 3D modeling through software that we share with the model with the client, but then we generate the CNC files and then we have at each facility, a CNC programmer who programs machines. Now that doesn't necessarily affect sort of the finger joint line or the press line for either the glue line or the CLT, the finishing and framing, you know, this is the true dynamic of mass timber comes into its own where every piece with a glue line. The necessary penetrations or routes actually cut into the panel, so in each panel or each glue line component goes to the job site, you know, they're completely pre finished with zero waste and ideally with zero rework as well. So, you know, we've got a limitation of the factory, but we are constantly we have a believe now 7C and CM machines across all three facilities and we're constantly updating both software and tooling heads. And that's because we have to stay at the forefront of technology. What type of coverage do you guys have in North America, like from a technical engineering detailing BIM side of things, like what's what's evolved over the last couple of years. Yeah, we have we have full coverage on over all over North America that includes Canada and United States and we have five regional managers distributed across across the continent from Canada to Eastern US West US, the city Northwest, of course. Also, the you know, the southern part of the US as Nick mentioned, we have plenty in Conway, Arkansas that serves very well that market with the South and yellow pine. A lumber and but also all over all over the North American continent, so I there is no place on North America where we don't have coverage. So, between the hour five regional managers, we have full coverage of the continent. So, yeah, their contacts are obviously on the website. But yeah, if you have any questions and you drop us a message, there's no place where we don't we don't do business in North America. That's good to hear. Well, we also heard that you offer installation services and you dig into that a little bit and tell us what you're now specializing in. Yeah, I mean, it was just a case of listening to the market. If you look at, I suppose myself and Ricardo's background with both help from the UK market, my background has been structures for three decades, be it structural steel or last December. Ricardo, we were actually competitive of each other in the UK, but the service offering was very much a design supply and construct model because that was true British design and build. And whilst the mass timber components predominantly came from Europe, we were still the responsible subcontractor. And therefore, it was already in our wheelhouse and experience to offer that service. We never intentionally set it up to be a construction business. But our clients, we see a mixture of clients that do self perform, which is great. So we will give them that designer system material supply and line with our project. Our clients are also installers themselves. And so therefore, it was about setting up a division not to compete against our clients far from it. And it was there for certain projects where the GC wants the full package in one house, because we will often make suggestions on who should be the best installer for that region, all that area. Because the end of day, you know, it's about if you pay us to do the install, you could argue it's profit on profits or why not go do the install yourself. Do like that full sort of design assist material supply and install. And so we listen to the market and so we give them back to the market what it's asking for, which is also similar to how we operate build systems, be a hybrid model, be a build system model. You know, it's about what the market wants. You know, mass timber is not the 100% answer to everything. It, but it is a big part of the solution that's required. So we can adapt ourselves to what the market wants because ultimately we just want to keep our factories busy. And so therefore you're trying to be not everything to everybody, but be able to offer more services. So like a number of projects, our clients say, look, we've got our own self perform team, but we've never done mass timber before. So what we'll do is is one of our construction supervisors, we can offer that service within that client. Say, look, we can do the materials by but would also give you the sort of site consultancy for the install to make sure the because in the day, it's not just about how to install mass timber. It's how we take care of the mass timber during the install process, you know, rainwater management, timber care procedures, everything is such an important journey because in the day we want, we want to have a client and we won't repeat business. You know, speaking about what the market wants and trends and stuff like that, you touched on a little bit, but I think the meat and potatoes of today's conversation is going to send around hybrid options. Can you tell us about why you guys are focusing on that and why you specifically wanted to talk about it? Yeah, so we see, mass timber, it's great. We all on this call, certainly we love mass timber. If it was our call and money was not barrier, we would love all buildings to be 100% mass timber. When reality strikes and budget strikes normally hybrid pencil out way better than pure mass timber. And we've been developing different options to hit that that sweet, sweet middle middle place where it's not 100% mass timber, but you still have some mass timber to expose and celebrate. So we see very, very good synergies between steel frame and mass timber. We see very good synergies with call form steel CFS and mass timber. And we see these two components specifically to be one of the vectors of growth for the industry in the next five, 10 years because again, the amount of volume and construction we have and the prices and the costs of mass timber. They are not 100% aligned yet. So this meat term, these kind of compromised solutions, they're probably good entry points, especially for people that are not so familiar with mass timber, they have a new steel. Or with other build systems that but mass timber is completely new to them, it's a very good entry point for those partners. I've come from a steel background and migrated a steel designing construct subcontractions into the belt of mass timber. What we found was steel and structural steel and mass timber of CRT, especially, is symbiotic to each other. They are designed, supplied, manufacturing and installed to identical tolerances, which is two millimeters or sixteenth of an inch. And therefore the processes is involved of say, a structural steel frame, pretty identical to the processes of a mass timber business. And therefore we're starting to see a lot of projects where we're seeing steel frame of CLT floors. As Ricardo said, we've now started to see a new world, especially in the short span residential accommodation market, where we're starting to see the use of CFS called form steel structures. And then that's not to replace timber frame because timber frame is still a very competitive marketplace. But timber frame is also limited to five six stories, absolute maximum under building code. When you want to build something above six stories, residential unit, say six to ten stories, when you default option is RC frame. We'll now start to see the world change and the use of CFS frame structures with CLT floor plates. So it's no different to a steel frame, a point loaded system with a CLT floor plate. Common denominator is using CLT mass timber as the floor construction. In the majority of buildings, 70% of the construction material goes in the floor as a primary structure. And CLT is just a natural use of replacing birth in situ or precast concrete floor systems. So for us, and that really suits our spoke comforts, which produces nothing but CLT. So for us, it's a good business case to promote and push hybrid structures. We're very fortunate to have our two facilities in Alcanagan and BC and in Conway and Arkansas that actually produce glue lamb. Because that then compliments the use of steel, glue lamb and CLT. So again, it's about not just having their capacity. It's also having the versatility to adapt to different build systems, be it an office block or an institution. An education or an accommodation building unit because the market changes constantly on building typology demand. And we've seen the residential market slow down very much over the last two to three years because of interest rates and geopolitical situations where the residential markets calmed. But that often creates pent up demand and we can see that pent up demand coming in the residential space. And that might be light in the frame with CLT or CFS with CLT. The common denominator is BCLT. And so this is where we're getting market ready in preparation for those build systems. How do you the thermal and acoustic performances of these systems work together? They work very well. So Timber, as you well know, it's naturally an insulating material. Right. So it has a very low R value about one R value of one per inch thickness a bit over one. So that works very well. And the call form steel system, for example, because it's so thin, it doesn't really, if you don't create thermal bridges very much. So it's very easy to thermally break a system like this from a cold bridges, et cetera. So it's very, it's very positive in that regard. Right. So when we're talking about call frame, call form steel systems, these are balls that have a very thin gauge. It's it's millimeter wise. We're talking five six mill maximum, sometimes three or four. So this we're talking about a 16 and eight of an inch thick. So it's it's not it's a 96 gauge. It's very unlikely on what some of these profiles 54 meals. It's the more it's the four. It's the more it's the more usual systems we see. So that means that termally we are not we don't have this thermal bridges that you have. For example, in a concrete building or still heavy steel frame. So this works much better acoustically there. Of course, challenges. We are dealing with light materials and the acoustic works kind of the other way around. They once must kind of buffer and dump the sound. So there is treatments that can be done. And their developments that have been done with the acoustic specialist, a few in North America, also in Europe to minimize the impact of ITC, STC, these factors for mass timber and combined structures, hybrid structures. The bottom line is that there are solutions out there to resolve the issue and more often than not. And we are the testament of that solutions have been found somewhere else in the world. And we can bring it to the table, given our expert expertise and experience. So very often we are confronted with never saw this before and become to the table. Yeah. Now actually we resolve that problem 10 years ago in Europe. So don't you worry about this one. Can you talk about real world costs and marrying the two technologies together CLT and the CFS code form steel compared to like traditional and maybe some positive some reasons why somebody should use this practice versus an old traditional way. Yeah. So if you were to look at it on a just a straight light for like structural comparison, there's the high probability on paper, it looked like it's more expensive. All there's a premium. The best way to look at every build system is to look at the holistic costs. We talk about the holistic costs. So use a CLT say compared to concrete in the floor construction. It's going to reduce the dead where which has a huge impact on the foundation design. There's like what? So there's an offset there. The other offset is about speed of construction. You know, chances I will be able to reduce the construction schedule by between 20 and 25%. Again, there's a huge saving in the GC site prelimbs associated. And then of course the developer is going to be able to realize that asset use much sooner. Combined with other smaller issues or follow on subtreads typically an RC frame. A follow on subtreads needs four stories to be built before they can then access by the time you remove what the back cropping. Whereas on the CLT they can access the building with only two stories ahead of them. So that's these these little nuances that using an offsite technology allows us to enhance and reduce the construction schedule. That has to be taken into account and then when you do that ultimate dynamic probably find that the use of an offsite build technology. Still frame, CFS, CLT is likely to have an overall impact on the construction cost of around about a seven of 11%. And that's what's not factored into consideration. And all depends on where as well. So what we're starting to see is certain projects in cities where you've got a lot of union level. What the whole idea of say an RC frame which is you know a lot of labor required on the job site. When we were dealing with one project and I think it was in California some of my car remember a couple years ago and the actual GC said I'm going for a still frame CLT, floor decks and prefabricated non-log bear and wall panels. And I asked why and he said because as a GC it's penting out to be cheaper because it factored in all the holistic benefits. That's associated with a lightweight dry construction solution in the structural frame. So that actually starts to pencil out you know plus then you get the benefits of of the you know the green and the sustainability that's associated with products and they'll cost the low carbon construction. That's impacted so over time when the market gets more familiar with the product then we'll start to see a huge. Huge you know huge opportunity for mass timber and North America's blessed with space with natural resource of wood products be it in Pacific Northwest or down in the southeast with something yellow pine. And and then of course we've got the land to build those facilities as well. And so we can only see nothing but growth in front of us and we see the growth be more exponential based on say current interest rates and pent up demand coming and hopefully when there's a presidential election out the way as well and the market starts to move. These all have impacts on the heart the economies of all and then when construction starts moving and residential comes into that the same time. We sort of forecast around 2026 onwards we start to see this inflection curve of huge growth demand and and that's that's not just those talking about it that's represented by woodworks and therefore casting that's also represented by the FIA the forest economics. You know guys they've already done similar projections so we're actually we're getting ourselves market ready for when the big push comes. It's scary but it's exciting at the same time and our challenge is a business will be to be able to scale up. And that will be the you know so it's okay filling the factories. But it's also case of well we need say an abundance of engineers and structural detail is to feed those factors as well so it's about the whole ecosystem. So you outline some of the high level trends opportunities challenges things that people have to be aware of in the space what about like when you zoom down into the building are they any design challenges with using these two systems integrate maybe like a CLT slab interface or limitations on using as a load bearing system. No definitely there's something different right so we normally try to approach it the other way around and say look at the similarities because the differences are minimum here right. And Nick mentioned a bit and touch base a bit on some of the advantages you know no need for back problem right if you if you look at this similar system full concrete on metal deck with CFS called called from still walls. That system exists for buildings probably for the last 10 years in the market in North America and what we're doing is just swapping the CLT slab. Sorry the concrete on metal deck slab with a CLT slab that by the way doesn't need any back problem it doesn't need any pinning down that's a huge saving on the costs and occupancy and able to move on with follow on trades on the on the lower force yes the devil is on the details as always in musty and it's the connection between CLT and CFS right so this is why it's important to have this holistic approach like to have here at Mercer where we are in full control in the nicest spot. The way of the term of the design the supply and installation potentially meaning that we know exactly how to coordinate the two trades very close together right so the way to deal with the issues on on the slabs it's to make sure that you don't punch the slabs if you want with the call form still stats. We can do a very rough analogy with the stick frame walls it's the same system with a different stud system being still frame right but you want to make sure especially when you go eight 10 stories and that's possible to do with this system so well beyond what stick frame can do. You need to make sure that you're not putting too much compression perpendicular to grain on these panels right and there is a lot of nuances there one of the nuances is species right so different species at different densities have different compression per grain capacities right so we sing a variety for example just talking about our trees not even going to other species but we can touch there we have SYP South and Yellow Pine that has a much better capacity. Then for example SPF has and that first sits right in the middle between the two but if we throw the Europeans into the equation we're probably talking about 40% reduction on compression per grain capacity on this thing so we need to factor all of these things and being holistically looking at the problem when compression per grain is not enough provided by the panel we need to work on a few solutions that allows if I will use the knowledge low to flow from top stats. But that's again only possible if we have control of where the studs are it cannot be a random start placement we need to know exactly where all the studs are placed so we can have a pass through solution right and this past solution can be many things still obviously it's just there in hand so we can look at the still solution grow solutions so a non shrink routes possible still components possible hardwood inserts again as I said before. All of these solutions have been worked in Europe. Nick he worked in large projects I work in large projects in Europe we used to build 15 years ago 12 storey structures right 15 storey so it's not it's not impossible so all the issues that we try to resolve here some has someone has resolved in Europe and beyond 48 it's building in in Australia and they used the hard dowel hardwood dowels to deal with compression per grain that was 50% reduction in the price of the price. 15 years ago so we don't need to invent these wills there of course details and nuances and tests we need to do to make sure that things are resolved and everyone is comfortable but from a code perspective and approval perspective it's very similar to all the other build systems we have seen in the market. Is there any nuances with like fire safety and very little so these buildings will be classified like an heavy timber building right so a type for the type 4 scene. Yeah as well but more type for the type for a for the call for the system it's pushing the limits of what it's the limits of call for my want to be I want to stress that it's not the limits of the CLD here it's the limits of the call for so in there those situations we are normally better off going to the hot wall still solution that we see on 15 18 storey buildings on the limits of the for type for a so when we're going to this build system. So this build systems with type for especially with the code provisions from 2024 Colorado Washington state California in some jurisdictions they're starting to adopt that that means type for B you can expose way more on 2021 provisions was pretty much all concealed. So in general in general now you can start exposing much more of the wood so and when you expose the woods the panels are designed to be fully fired rated so the fire with the 5 inch sorry the 5 ply 6 and 7 8. So we can achieve 2 hours fire I will say comfortably it's not super comfortably but yeah we are confident there that we have tests done you have you know theoretical models showing the same behavior so we are very confident that these systems can provide us with the fire needs that codes require so from a code perspective again there's not being to be afraid of so it's not different from what you've done before and CLD can perform. So what's good to know on like the logistics and coordination sign is there anything that people need to do differently integrating mass timber and CFS and they would from any other building material. I think that's more Ricardo but I think we'll both say exactly the same it's about early collaboration early court action because what ultimately dictates the efficiencies of mass timber is a grain on grid lines. And where we're going to put the load bearing members whether it's a load bearing still column or it's a load bearing CFS line loaded wall it's all about where we agree to put the grid lines because often we may get center projects say an RC frame and several just replicate that. Well that's not always the case because a grid line is often predetermined about the structural material that you use and if something's already designed in RC frame or something's designed with a different grid line we're often having to and a good example of that even we have that today and I give you a good example recently where a client said we've gone to Europe I've got a great price for mass timber but I want to use American you know manufacturers. Last timber and we say okay well the Europeans can only ship to contendowets we can do much wider longer panels we're not restricted by contendowets but by the way to get the efficiencies we want to change the grid we can make the big gridder the grid bigger in itself and therefore we can reduce the number of say picks and install but the clients as well were already pretty designed the grid. So therefore you know it's it's it's so that what the answer is is a collaboration doesn't matter what the build systems going to be it's about well what's the most efficient use now you could argue all that removes competitive edge because I'm going to go to which manufacturer. But to be honest you're going to get the same value and you're going to get the same market price so it's about a leap of faith and is about trusts in our collaboration. And now we know what we find ourselves because because mass timber's on the on the increase we're starting to see a lot more from clients who are more keen to reserve capacity in order to reserve capacity than they have to single out who they're going to work with so now we're finding we're getting more design assists where we can create the opportunity for value engineering. And we please don't think that we you know we push mass timber into every opportunity no we use the right material in the right place and we'll only say that as well you know this doesn't mean not so mass timber you know this is an alternative cheaper build system because the end of the day everything is driven by cost as well. And we're currently aware and there's nothing worse in trying to force mass timber as 100% solution when at the end of the day the job's not going to go ahead because it's cost driven. So we're very sort of so we say sensitive to the clients you know capacity's on spending now that you're offering design assist and then the installation services and you're overseeing everything at this point for this new technology the CLT and then the cold form steel. Do you is this like a prototype you're working into or do you have real world projects that you can already point to right. But were you out in that process well so I was very fortunate that my time between Caterin North America and Mercer North America when I went back to the UK I purposely went back and I was an executive director of the UK's largest cold form steel design and manufacturing and build contractor. With the and I know and I was asked to join the business to introduce CLT as an alternative to Deccan concrete. So already in the UK we were building CFS structures up to 12 store is quite comfortably using Deccan concrete. So just a natural evolution of introducing CLT as a much light work and quick construction method. So that's already been trialled and done and all we're doing now is I suppose similar with myself and Ricardo coming from Europe is we're just bringing over that knowledge and technology and what Ricardo said early was beautiful the devils in the detail well we've been to details both sides of the Atlantic to suit mass timber and CFS and that knowledge we're trying to make freely available because that's what's going to open up the market and I think when you get one or two built. It's like mass timber back in 2013 maybe one job here one job there but then when people see it and have confidence then this thing thinking right we can do this mass timber has gone through a good 10 years here in North America. And this is why it's accelerating on itself bringing this alternative build system is actually nothing you. It just needs proving out here in North America and I think there are some projects already being built in CFS CLT maybe lower rise but it's the word of true market is going to be I believe is going to be the six to 10 store market for an economy accommodation sector that covers a multitude of buildings that might be residential that might be student accommodation it may even be home. It's the accommodation market. I will just want to add to it yeah exactly like Nick said that the market is opening a lot that there's nothing really new to to what we're doing here but yeah there's we want to pass this there should be confidence that these details have been worked out probably not all in one place but has been worked out. That's for your question about projects we are aware of some projects that this has been trialled not by Mercer yet but not to the scale we want to do right so what we need to understand is that this technology it's something that needs to scale up significantly right so when we've the capacity production capacity we have between our three plans which is 255,000 cubic meters I've just done a big math when I was with you guys at the mass timber group summit in in Denver. And that was a truck every 52 minutes out of the plants every single working day of the year so you if you're doing these many trucks a day at 10 12 15 trucks a day you need to have the build system and the structure to follow it up right so we need to have a messy building student accommodation or hotel that needs these thousands of square foot today it's not a truck a week that's not what we're talking we're talking five 10 trucks a day. On a building of these guys right well you I got to say Nick what you said earlier really got me my sparked my curiosity about how all of the talking heads and the people that look at the trends are speculating that 2026 is right around the corner and it's bringing good news you know it's we're coming out of this you know I some people call depression or this recession that we're a little bit out of like just a stagnant period so I know me and Brady we we are a little bit on our own. We're going to push forward with a residential mass timber project in Mizzula Montana the market turned obviously it turned for everybody and so we're we're just kind of trying to figure out where it's going to go so that's that's really get insight for for 2026 knowing that what is you know Mercer after in the future what's next I know there's some big hurdles that just got over but more in that two to three year trajectory into 2026 and 27 you know whatever I say still about market driven forces. It's about the market you know we've seen this downplay in the residential market and one the a was learned from from nearly four decades ago is the one thing that's of in Elastic supply and the planet is housing cars washing machines you know it's up and down there are there of Elastic supply whereas we're a growing population the planet is growing we need housing and what often happens is housing is often stagnated by political situations. There's a lot of economic problems or our economics of interest rates. They always sort of stop and pull the market and the developers have the control the guys the people who are in the lamp pretty much dictate what's going to happen in our market but what I've seen since what been in four decades of construction I've seen cycles of stagnation recession boom bust and what is always apparent is you know a lot of projects take your projects projects don't die they just get paused but when they do go. When they do come online will sort of a number of other projects come online and that's why you get this incredible pent up demand and every time there's a change every time there's a cycle that comes round the change in the needle always points towards more off site technologies and I think let's look at history post world water when there was huge demand for housing what did the world turn to well the UK and Australia turn to pre fabricated. The technology flat pack construction our CFS CRT model is a form of flat pack construction just it's it's a mixture of digital technology of VDC and with pre fabricated solution so we've come along way in 80 years we're just solution ready for when the next demand comes because population is still growing wherever you go on the planet and I'm starting to see I'm starting to see the green shoes. Even my home land turf in the UK already speak to all our friends and colleagues that we've master the last four decades they just send housing market just about to burst and you know and and hopefully you know that the horrendous geopolitical situation between you create a Russia is playing a big part of the slow down of the stagnation of the world economy well when that gets settled you know you will get switched on again and demand will be here. So I'm going to say that's a huge and I you'll see this confidence come back now whether it's going to be 2026 you could say is that just wishful thinking well no that's based on evidence that's presented to us by say woodworks and the FIA. It might not be 2026 could be 2028 but at some point it has to turn because we see it now in the types in the number of inquiries we have the still very few residential projects it's all projects like the TRP. The TRP project you know institutional projects educational projects our office was building offices as well and that will probably be a natural slow down anywhere of the new modern working world of home hybrid working so there's going to be less demand for offices without more pressure more on building and but that and I'm going to say my home building you know we can see that demand not so much for single family but multi family arms because we're also seeing this huge next generation of sort of a lot of people. Of sort of living and working back in the inner cities again to get that work life balance so I think there's a lot of evidence that points in that direction and the end of the whole CFS CLT model that we're heavily invested in is because the market's asking us we're not going out there and pushing this great idea which we want everybody to buy well we know if you come up with a great idea nobody wants to buy it it's doomed and we're just listening to what the market was. Well that's very well put you have some unbelievable projects out there in this world and I hope people go to MercerMastember.com and check some of those out one of my favorites that just kind of opened up is that the bridge the High Line Mass Timber Bridge in New York have you had the pleasure of walking across it yet. Not yet but we will do. That was a feat of engineering itself. Really yeah it's stunning I it's on my bucket list to get out there just walk up and you know how one of those big all the columns on it so well thank you so much gentlemen and yeah if you thought the 2024 Mass Timber Group Summit Denver was a good time or card I wear steadily planning 2025 so we're going to have some big announcements coming out in the next couple a couple weeks about that so without further ado gentlemen we hope to talk to you soon and we'll see you around the industry. Thank you thank you thank you thank you.
